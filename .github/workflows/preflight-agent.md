# Preflight Gate — adherence judgment only

You judge ONLY spec/plan adherence. Deterministic facts (spec/plan/docs/tests
presence) are computed by the engine's checks — do NOT recompute them.

1. Read `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/ai-checks.json` (the check ids to judge). If it is `[]`,
   write evidence with an empty `checks` list (see step 4) — there is no artifact
   to judge against — and stop.
2. Read `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/pr.diff`, `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/spec.txt`, `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/plan.txt`,
   and the engine's `task-context.json` (`pr`, `iteration`, `feedback` — fold prior
   feedback into this pass).
3. For each requested id, judge the diff against the located artifact text ONLY
   (never infer an artifact):
   - `spec-adherence`: does the diff achieve what `spec.txt` requires?
   - `plan-adherence`: does the diff follow `plan.txt`?
   status: pass = adheres, warn = partial, fail = does not. Base every verdict on
   real evidence from the diff.
4. Write `/tmp/gh-aw/evidence.json` (the engine evidence path) as ONE JSON object:
   `{"checks":[{"id":"<id>","status":"pass|fail|warn","summary":"…","evidence":[{"label":"…","detail":"…"}],"remediation":"…"}], "examined":["<files you read in the diff>"]}`
   Include one `checks` entry per requested id; `examined` lists the changed files
   you inspected. Write nothing else.
