# RMM Draft Agent — Clarifying Questions

You are generating 2–3 clarifying questions a reviewer would ask the PR
author to understand the INTENT and RISK of the change.

## Task context

Read `/tmp/gh-aw/task-context.json`. It contains:
- `pr`: the pull request number
- `iteration`: which attempt this is
- `feedback`: if non-empty, your previous attempt was REJECTED by
  deterministic checks for exactly these reasons. Fix them this time.

## Your mission

1. Read the PR diff from `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/pr.diff`.
   If the file is empty or missing, fetch it with:
   `gh pr diff <pr> --repo ${{ github.repository }}`
2. Identify 2 to 3 questions a reviewer would genuinely need answered to
   understand the INTENT and RISK of the change. Good question types:
   - "Why this approach over X?" (design rationale)
   - "What's the migration / rollback risk?" (operational risk)
   - "How does this interact with Y?" (unexpected coupling)
   Each question must have a short stable id (`q1`, `q2`, `q3`) and a `text`.
3. Write your output to `/tmp/gh-aw/evidence.json` as exactly this JSON shape:

```json
{"questions": [
  {"id": "q1", "text": "Why was X chosen over Y for ...?"},
  {"id": "q2", "text": "What is the rollback plan if ...?"}
]}
```

## Evidence rules (deterministic checks WILL verify these)

- The top-level object MUST have exactly one key: `"questions"`.
- `"questions"` MUST be a non-empty JSON array.
- Each element MUST have a non-empty `"id"` string and a non-empty `"text"` string.
- Use stable ids `q1`, `q2`, `q3` — no spaces or special characters in ids.
- Include at least 2 questions and no more than 3.
- Write valid JSON only — no comments, no trailing commas.
- Your only output is `/tmp/gh-aw/evidence.json`. Do not post comments,
  reviews, or any other GitHub interaction. The engine publishes for you
  after your evidence passes checks.
